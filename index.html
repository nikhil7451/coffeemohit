    <h2><em>House blend coffee</em></h2>

      There are a variety of different coffee blends around the world today, so
      choosing one can be a bit difficult. Before we get into what makes a house
      blend special, here is a quick look at a few different coffee blends.
      Breakfast Blends are generally a light roast of coffee that is not
      overwhelmingly flavorful but is very full of caffeine. They are not known
      to be full-bodied, like a dark blend, but that does not mean they are weak
      or watery. Breakfast blends are often described as mild and well balanced;
      “a perfect start to your day.” House Blends can often be described as
      reliable and straightforward – a blend that is a “go-to” in a coffee shop.
      They are generally seen as a consistent and high-value product that you
      can count on. The brew of a house blend coffee is different than that of a
      breakfast blend or espresso roast – meaning that when you pour a cup of a
      house blend coffee, you should expect to fall somewhere in the middle of a
      light roast and dark roast and have intermediate flavor. Here at Carta
      Coffee, our house blends are our Captain's Roast and Meridian Roast
      coffees. Dark Roasted Blends are full-bodied, smoky, flavors. Due to
      extended time in the roaster, the caffeine levels are lower than that of
      the lighter roasted blends. However, the aroma and flavor are stronger.

    <h2><em>French roast coffee</em></h2>

    <p style="width: 50%;">
      Simply put, “French roast” describes the color of the coffee beans after
      they have been roasted. These beans are on the darker end of the scale,
      and are usually the color of dark chocolate. It does not mean the coffee
      was grown or roasted in France.

        1800s)</strong

    <h2><em>Espresso</em></h2>
    <br />
    <img src="./images/photo2.jpeg" width="350" alt="" />
    <br />
    <p style="width: 50%;">
      Espresso is made by forcing very hot water under high pressure through
      finely ground compacted coffee. Tamping down the coffee promotes the
      water's even penetration through the grounds. This process produces an
      almost syrupy beverage by extracting both solid and dissolved components.
      The crema is produced by emulsifying the oils in the ground coffee into a
      colloid, which does not occur in other brewing methods. There is no
      universal standard defining the process of extracting espresso, but
      several published definitions attempt to constrain the amount and type of
      ground coffee used, the temperature and pressure of the water, and the
      rate of extraction.Generally, one uses an espresso machine to make
      espresso. The act of producing a shot of espresso is often called
      "pulling" a shot, originating from lever espresso machines, with which a
      barista pulls down a handle attached to a spring-loaded piston, which
      forces hot water through the coffee at high pressure.
