      <strong
        >The Grind is open in Westchase! We are excited to introduce our Coffee
        Shop & Cafe. If you crave great coffee, you’ll love knowing that we
        provide a real alternative to chains with handcrafted coffee and
        espresso drinks, a full tea bar, and real food options. “We grind for
        you”… our local baristas know that great espresso takes more than
        pushing a button. We work hard to deliver great taste while also
        providing knowledgeable service, perfect if you just want to try
        something new. Our Cafe delivers way beyond the traditional coffee shop
        favorites (although we think our homemade pastries are pretty good). We
        have traditional breakfast choices, including eggs and pancakes, and
        plenty of healthy options (including gluten free, vegetarian, and
        vegan). Our lunch offerings include a wide variety of salads, sandwiches
        and flatbreads. And as for the late nighters… we know you’ll appreciate
        having a spot for your dessert fix as well as a spiked coffee. And as a
        final quick intro to “us”- the owners: we are Westchase residents (no
        franchise or corporate owners in sight). Our first Grind, The Campus
        Grind, opened a few years ago at USF St Pete and has provided us with
        real world experience to make sure The Grind at Westchase can actually
        deliver what we promise- a great coffee shop/cafe experience.</strong
